### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Chris, and  I first got interested in software development when I learned I could edit and create new [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) levels.  The 1993 version, not to date myself.

These days I spend most of my time helping developers and organizations ship secure high quality software faster via [Saturday Morning Producitons](https://saturdaymp.com/).  Give me a [shout](https://calendly.com/saturdaymp) if you need a hand securing, upgrading, devops, or just getting your software out the door on time and under budget.

I enjoy sharing my knowledge and paying it forward.  One way I do this is by contributing to and maintaining open source projects.  I encourage you to an issue or PR if you spot a bug or have an improvement in the projects I [maintain](https://github.com/saturdaymp).  Please also [ping](https://saturdaymp.com/contact) me if you spot an open source project that could use my help.

Another way I share my knowledge is on the [SaturdayMP Show](https://www.youtube.com/@saturdaymp) and by [presenting](https://github.com/saturdaymp-examples) either virtually or in-person.  [Ping](https://saturdaymp.com/contact) me if you have a question you would like me to answer on the SaturdayMP Show or would like me to present at your conference, meetup, or company.

I am active in the local Edmonton development community, such as [Dev Edmonton](https://devedmonton.com/), and attend international conferences when possible.  Say hi if you see me at an event!

I created and host the [Weekly Dev Chat](https://weeklydevchat.com/) and am a co-host of the [Legacy Code Rocks](https://legacycode.rocks/) Virtual Meetup. These are casual virtual chats that everyone and anyone is welcome to attend, including you.

If you appreciate the free resources I provide please let me know by clicking the subscribe/like/star/etc buttons, sharing with others, sending me a [message](https://saturdaymp.com/contact) or via [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/saturdaymp).  I also accept constructive feedback on what I can improve.

All the best!
